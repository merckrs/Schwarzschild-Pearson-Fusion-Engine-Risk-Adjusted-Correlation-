This indicator applies principles from General Relativity (Schwarzschild Metric) and Information Theory to solve the biggest problem in correlation analysis: The False Positive.

Standard correlation indicators only check Direction (do they move together?). They fail to check Structure (do they share the same risk profile?) or Substance (is there real volume backing the move?). This tool acts as a "Physics Engine" for your portfolio.

How it Works:

    Adaptive Gravity (G): It measures market entropy (volatility) of the Anchor symbol. When the market is chaotic, the gravity increases, tightening the filters automatically.

    Schwarzschild Metric: It calculates the "Mass" of the asset based on its Variance and Volume. It then measures the topological distance (Ψ) between the Asset and the Anchor.

        If the "Mass Difference" is too high, an Event Horizon is created, pushing the distance to infinity regardless of correlation.

    Density Gate (Volume Veto): A failsafe mechanism. If the asset's money flow (Dollar Volume) is statistically insignificant compared to the Anchor (e.g., <1%), it is marked as "Ghost Matter" and immediately vetoed.

How to Use (The Traffic Light System):

    GREEN LINE (Ψ<0.5): Safe Zone. The asset is structurally aligned with the Anchor. High correlation, compatible variance, solid volume. Signal: CONFIRMED.

    RED LINE (Ψ>1.0): Event Horizon Crossed. The asset has decoupled from the Anchor's reality. It is either too volatile or structurally unsound. Signal: REJECT.

    GRAY BACKGROUND: VETO (Ghost Trap). The price might be rising, but there is no liquidity backing it. This detects "Pump & Dump" schemes or low-float traps. Signal: DANGER / NO TRADE.

Settings:

    Anchor Symbol: The benchmark you are comparing against (e.g., NASDAQ:QQQ for Tech, SPY for General Market, BTCUSDT for Crypto).

    Volume Veto Threshold: The minimum liquidity density required relative to the Anchor (Default 1%).
